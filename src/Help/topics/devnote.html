    Hallo <strong>Anabrid-Mitarbeiter!</strong>
    Bitte schaut euch die folgenden Kurzinstruktionen an bevor ihr
    diese Web-Anwendung durchklickt!
</div>

<p>Please note that this application is still in heavy development. <strong>You are very much invited</strong>
    to test out what is already possible and report not only <strong>problems</strong> and bugs,
    but also <strong>expectations or nice-to-have features</strong>. Please use one of the 
    following channels to do so:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Open a <a href="https://lab.analogparadigm.com/lucidac/software/lucidac-gui/-/issues/new">new ticket</a></strong>
        in the <a href="https://lab.analogparadigm.com/lucidac/software/lucidac-gui/-/issues">bug tracker</a> of our gitlab project</li>
    <li>You can also submit a
        <a href="mailto:gitlab+lucidac-software-lucidac-gui-257-d1ykn0opqs6ae6xzq8v71ibwa-issue@anabrid.dev">new ticket by mail</a>.</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>Sentry "Report a Bug"</strong> button (but read the limitations below)</li>
    <li>Only as fallback: Make screenshots, write on Mattermost</li>
</ul>
<p>Please consider the following <strong>limitations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Limited mobile support</strong>:
        Please note that this website basically works on mobile phones, but is <strong>not</strong>
        (yet) tailored to be used on your <strong>smartphone or tablet</strong>. That is, it is currently
        best to be used on a desktop or laptop!
    <li>Please <strong>disable your adblocker</strong> for this page, if applicable, in order to allow
        sentry to work (see below).</li>
</ul>
<h3>On the error tracking software Sentry</h3>
<p>
    To simplify user reports even further, we use the
    Application Perfromance Monitoring & Error Tracking Software
    <a href="https://sentry.io/">sentry</a>. This allows you to report user feedback
    even easier by clicking the <em>report a bug</em> button in the lower right,
    which will automatically also include a screenshot and internal debugging details.
    A few comments about sentry:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>We see the issue that sentry silently ignores user feedback. Therefore
        <strong>do not write long texts</strong> in the feedback form but use a
        well tested media instead (such as gitlab ticket).
    </li>
    <li>Sentry may be <strong>blocked by your adblocker</strong> because it can also be used for tracking users (which we don't do).
        Please consider disabling your adblocker for this page.</li>
    <li>Sentry is known not to work too well with <strong>Firefox</strong> (it silently ignores your bug reports).
        Consider using Chrome or similar browsers (Edge, Safari).
    </li>
    <li>Note: We will provide an opt-in/opt-out for sentry performance monitoring in the future to comply with
        GDPR. Currently the software is in development. We probably also will get rid of sentry in favour
        of another solution.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>This application is open source. The code is hosted at
    <a href="https://lab.analogparadigm.com/lucidac/software/lucidac-gui">gitlab: lucidac/software/lucidac-gui</a>.
    You may also consider to have a look at the <a href="#/help/readme">project README file</a> for further details.
    The project was initiated by Sven in Feb/March 2024.

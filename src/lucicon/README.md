## The LUCIDAC Hybrid Controller, Typescript implementation
 
 A lean and mean minimal asynchronous LUCIDAC HybridController client
 library in modern ECMAScript.
 
 The implementation is given in a few typescript files which have minimal
 dependencies to a few npm packages.

 In particular, the file `svelte-stores.ts` is the only one with depency
 to any Svelte code and any dependency to other code within this repository.

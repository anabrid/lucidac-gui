<h2 class="title">On using this app</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">Readme for first time users</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>Please note that this application is in early development (you are in fact
    using version {ClientDefaults.app_name_and_version}). You are very much invited
    to test out what is already possible and report problems, expectations, inconsistencies
    bugs, etc in form of a <a href="https://lab.analogparadigm.com/lucidac/software/lucidac-gui/-/issues/new">new ticket</a>
    on our <a href="https://lab.analogparadigm.com/lucidac/software/lucidac-gui/-/issues">bug tracker</a>.
    You can also submit a
    <a href="mailto:gitlab+lucidac-software-lucidac-gui-257-d1ykn0opqs6ae6xzq8v71ibwa-issue@anabrid.dev">new ticket by mail</a>.

    To simplify user reports even further, we use the
    Application Perfromance Monitoring & Error Tracking Software
    <a href="https://sentry.io/">sentry</a>. This allows you to report a bug
    even easier by clicking the <em>report a bug</em> button in the lower right,
    which will automatically also include a screenshot and internal debugging details.
    A few comments about sentry:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sentry may be blocked by your adblocker because it can also be used for tracking users (which we don't do).
        Consider disabling your adblocker for this page.</li>
    <li>Sentry is known not to work too well with Firefox (it silently ignores your bug reports).
        Consider using Chrome or similar browsers (Edge, Safari).
    </li>
    <li>We will provide an opt-in/opt-out for sentry performance monitoring in the future to comply with
        GDPR. Currently the software is in development. We probably also will get rid of sentry in favour
        of another solution.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>This application is open source. The code is hosted at
    <a href="https://lab.analogparadigm.com/lucidac/software/lucidac-gui">gitlab: lucidac/software/lucidac-gui</a>.
    You may also consider to have a look at the <a on:click={info_modal_open.toggle}>project README file</a> for further details.
    The project was initiated by Sven in Feb/March 2024.

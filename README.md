# JavaScript Single Page Application for LUCIDAC

This repo shall hold

- A JavaScript client for the JSONL lucidac protocol
- A simple SPA (probably using Vue)

Following the idea of [#58: Simple Webserver for LUCIDAC](https://lab.analogparadigm.com/lucidac/firmware/hybrid-controller/-/issues/58).

Since all files are static HTMLs, self-hosting on a PC is a no-brainer (can be for instance `python -m http.server`). 

We also don't want big dependencies on NPM and anything. The whole application shall be rather simple.
